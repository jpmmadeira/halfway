## halfway



Project developed by a team of 5, during a 24 hour Hackaton project as part of the 3rd and final project at <Academia de Código_>. 
For this particular hackaton , we joined forces between Porto and Fundão, and the teams were created with people from these two bootcamps.
After the 24 hours period we had to present this ideia to our Master Coders, Code Cadets, IT company representatives and more.  



### The Idea 

The Hackathin started at 10 am with a song - "Livin' on a Prayer" , by  Bon Jovi. We quickly knew that this was a very powerful theme.
We researched about the author, the origin of the song and lyrics, and the impact in society/community. Rapidly we identified our stories with the main one from the song.
Which described a couple that had many struggles throughout their lives but as long as they had a purpose, a goal , and they worked together they would eventually achieve their goals.
We quickly related ourselves, developers to this situation, basically, we need to work as teams, establish our goals and fight our obstacles together so in the end we achieve what we want. 
Halfway purpose is to create an online tool that allows developers and investors to find a common ground and invest in amazing ideias. 

### Development

In my team, we were only able to met everyone on the day of the challenge. 
From moment zero, each developer did a brief 5 minute presentation about himself, declaring his qualities and difficulties and from that moment we started researching about the song/theme. 
We also implemented an AGILE mindset and used a scrum strategy to work our challenge through . 

### My Role 

I was responsible to organize the team throughout the development of the project.  I have allocated each developer a task and made sure the person was competent to do it in time of the next sprint since time was very important. 
I also contributed mostly in developing the backend and all the business logic, peer programming for the frontend , and created the presentation of our project. 
We managed to accomplish our minimum viable product within time and had the chance to develop even further of what we establish in the beginning.
